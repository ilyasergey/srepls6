	<p class="myclass" style="width:620px"
	align="justify">Fault-tolerant distributed algorithms play an
	important role in many critical/high-availability
	applications. These algorithms are notoriously difficult to
	implement correctly, due to asynchronous communication and the
	occurrence of faults, such as the network dropping messages or
	computers crashing.</p>

	<p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify">One
	fundamental obstacle in having correct fault-tolerant
	distributed algorithms is the lack of abstractions when
	reasoning about their behaviors. In this talk we discuss the
	impact of partially synchronous programming abstractions in
	increasing the confidence we have in fault-tolerant
	systems. We will focus on partially synchronous models that
	view asynchronous faulty systems as synchronous ones with an
	adversarial environment that simulates asynchrony and faults
	by dropping messages. This view simplifies the proof arguments
	making systems amendable to automated verification.  We apply
	partial synchrony to algorithms that solve agreement problems,
	such as consensus and state machine replication.</p>

	<p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify">Technically, we
	take a programming language perspective and define a domain
	specific language which has a high-level partially synchronous
	semantics and compiles into efficient asynchronous code.  We
	validate our technique by defining partially synchronous
	implementations of algorithms like Paxos, whose verification
	becomes now automated, and which compile into efficient
	asynchronous code, that preserves the properties verified
	under the partially synchronous semantics.  </p>

       the native features of the Scala programming language, type
       system and standard library, to introduce (1) a representation
       of protocols (session types) as Scala types, and (2) a

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify"><br/>Go is a production-level
       statically typed programming language whose design features
       explicit message-passing primitives and lightweight threads,
       enabling (and encouraging) programmers to develop concurrent
       systems where components interact through communication more so
       than by lock-based shared memory concurrency. Go can detect
       global deadlocks at runtime, but does not provide any
       compile-time protection against all too common communication
       mismatches and partial deadlocks.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify"> In this work we present a
       static verification framework for liveness and safety in Go
       programs, able to detect communication errors and deadlocks by
       model checking. Our toolchain infers from a Go program a
       faithful representation of its communication patterns as
       behavioural types, where the types are model checked for
       liveness and safety.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify"><br/>The Whiley programming
       language and verifying compiler have been under development
       since 2009.  The language itself was designed with verification
       in mind, and certain choices reflect this.  For example, the
       use of unbound arithmetic and structural typing.  The language
       also has some other notable features, such as the use of flow
       typing with union, intersection and negation types.
       Furthermore, Whiley has recently gained support for reference
       lifetimes, similar to those found in Rust.  Reference lifetimes
       open up more possibilities in terms of both verification and
       efficient implementation.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify">In this talk, I'll
       demonstrate the system being used to verify some useful
       programs.  I'll also examine and reflect on some of the
       interesting technical challenges faced so far.  For example,
       the implementation of recursive structural types with unions,
       intersections and negations turned out to surprisingly
       involved.  Likewise, the system includes a purpose-built
       automated theorem prover which has proved (unsurprisingly) to
       be an interesting challenge.</p><br/>

       protection mechanisms, such as Intel’s SGX, ARM’s TrustZone,

       powerful low-level attackers. In this work, we use enclaves to
       enforce strong application-specific information security
       policies.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify">We present IMPE, a novel
       calculus that captures the essence of SGX-like enclave
       mechanisms, and show that a security-type system for IMPE can
       enforce expressive confidentiality policies (including erasure
       policies and delimited release policies) against powerful
       low-level attackers, including attackers that can arbitrarily
       corrupt non-enclave code, and, under some circumstances,
       corrupt enclave code.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify">We present a translation
       from an expressive security-typed calculus (that is not aware
       of enclaves) to IMPE. The translation automatically places code
       and data into enclaves to enforce the security policies of the
       source program.</p><br/>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify"><br/>Modern multiprocessors
       typically provide memory models that are weaker than sequential
       consistency, and much work has been done by the programming
       languages community to formalise and prove theorems about these
       models for a variety of architectures.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify">Several modern
       multiprocessors also provide transactional memory (TM), such as
       Intel's Haswell and IBM's Power8. Much work has been done to
       study the semantics of TM in a sequentially-consistent setting,
       but the precise guarantees TM provides in a weak memory setting
       have received little attention. In this work, we investigate
       how the axiomatic approach for modelling weakly-consistent
       memory can be extended to handle TM, with particular reference
       to the ARM and Power architectures.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify">We follow a novel iterative
       methodology for developing models of TM in a weak memory
       setting. Given the current iteration of the model and a
       possible refinement of it, we use a constraint-solver to
       generate all litmus tests (of a bounded size) that
       differentiate the two. We then decide whether to accept the
       refinement by examining these tests, discussing them with
       microarchitectural engineers, and running them on available
       hardware.</p>

       verification, with the automaton type varying depending on the

       for increasingly complex types of automata have to be developed
       from scratch because there is no abstract theory offering
       guidelines. This makes it hard to devise such algorithms, and
       it obscures their correctness proofs.</p>

     <div id="Huntbach" class="collapse">
       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify"><br/>Core Aldwych is a simple
       model for concurrent computation, involving the concept of
       agents that communicate through shared variables. Each variable
       will have exactly one agent that can write to it, and its value
       can never be changed once written, but a value can contain
       further variables that are written to later. A key aspect is
       that the reader of a value may become the writer of variables
       in it. In this paper we show how this model can be used to
       encode lambda calculus.  Individual function applications can
       be explicitly encoded as lazy or not, as required. We then show
       how this encoding can be extended to cover functions that
       manipulate mutable variables, but with the underlying Core
       Aldwych implementation still using only immutable
       variables. The ordering of function applications then becomes
       an issue, with Core Aldwych able to model either the
       enforcement of an ordering or the retention of indeterminate
       ordering, which allows parallel execution.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify"><br/>CakeML is an impure
       functional programming language aimed at supporting formally
       verified programs. The CakeML project has several aspects
       including formal semantics and metatheory, a verified compiler,
       a mechanised connection between its semantics and higher-order
       logic (in the HOL4 interactive theorem prover), and an example
       verified theorem prover written in CakeML and HOL4. It also has
       respectable performance compared to industrial-strength
       implementations of ML.</p>

       <p class="myclass" style="width:620px" align="justify">The CakeML project has been
       running for five years and has achieved its initial goal of
       demonstrating the feasibility of a practical, mechanically
       verified compiler from program source text to target machine
       code. But where should we go from here? In this talk, I will
       present a nascent project on verifying core UNIX utilities,
       focussing on sort and grep. These examples are interesting
       because they interact with the outside world and perform pure
       computation. I will explain how we combine two different
       techniques to verify these programs: Arthur Charguéraud's
       characteristic formulae, and our own proof-producing
